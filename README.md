# ESP32-014-DIY-Smart-RFID-Door-Lock-with-ESP32
This RFID Door Lock System uses an ESP32 and an RC522 RFID module to unlock doors using RFID cards. When an authorized card is scanned, the servo motor rotates to unlock the door, while the buzzer provides audio feedback — making it a compact, secure, and IoT-ready access control system.
